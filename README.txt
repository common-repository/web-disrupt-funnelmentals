== Description ==
Web Disrupt's Funnelmentals is changing the way people build sites with WordPress & Elementor. We try to make it so anyone can build beautiful funnels.

The biggest things about creating funnels is analytics. We have integrated Google Analytics and the Facebook pixel which extends Elementor. 
We have also included permissions, floating image, and advanced button.

### Widgets
**Floating Image** Allows you to add an image/icon with advanced positioning and animation. Used to increase engagement and customer focus.
**Advanced Button** Allows you to trigger classes and the visibility of other elements. It also has some advanced visual customizations.
**Permissions** This element can redirect users and toggle visibility based on your user's status. Events can be triggered if logged in, logged out, or based on if the user has bought specific products through WooCommerce.
**Trigger External Tracking** You can trigger any GA and Pixel events based on different user actions. These events can be on page load, timed, or triggered with a click.

### Global Controls
** Hide hidden widget**, which is a useful control to have when using the advance button to show sections or other widgets.

### Pro Widgets
**Checkout Pro** This element allows you to transform the WooCommerce buying process to a single page experience. If you are using WooCommerce, this is a must-have feature. Because the less time it takes your customer to purchase your product the more conversions you will make. So let us help you maximize your conversion today!
**Copyright Footer** This should be self-explanatory. It is a customizable copyright with current year for the footer of your site. Set it and forget it.
**Urgency Countdown** This isn't the typical Elementor countdown. This countdown functions precisely as a sales tool. It allows you to assign a base time and add a random amount of time on top of that. It gives the user the impression that a deal or time limit is about to run out. The best part about this time is that it will continue to count down from the same point even on page refresh. This countdown is a must-have for sales pages.
**Downloads Pro** This Allows you to customize the download page or add a custom download button. You can specify a specific product's downloads or all downloads. You even have you the ability to grab the downloads from a product someone just purchased by placing it on the checkouts Pro Thankyou Page. 
**Shortcodes Pro** This element allows you to access some of WooCommerce best shortcodes and completely redesign them.
**Video Playlist** Allows you to create video courses with a playlist of videos which can be entered manually or uploaded with a spreadsheet.
**IFrame Pro** Great for showing content from other sites or condense parts of your own site. Also can be used to display Checkouts Pro with custonm post types and on blog posts.
**Upsell Button** Add simple cart extentions to add upsell products to your shopping cart/checkout process.
**User Tasker** Allows you to display lessons and checkmark them off as you go.
**User Tasker Progress bar** Works with user tasker to track the progress of a user.

### Pro Extensions
** WordPress Register ** Adds WordPress user registration to Elementor Pro Form Actions. Now you can sign up members for your site at the same time adding them to your mailing list.

The goal of Funnelmentals is not to replace Elementor Pro. Our goal is to enhance it with some cool much-needed features. Your patronage will go a long way to making this plugin even better.
